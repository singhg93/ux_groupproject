## App Name: Grocery pooling

There are two groups of users using the app. The first group are
the users who post their grocery list on the app. The other group
can go on the app and check if any person in their area needs help
getting the groceries, and then they can accept the request. It is
basically Uber for Groceries.

## Inspiration

The conditions created by pandemic.

## How is the idea novel?

It has been made very clear by the pandemic that
many elderly people often don't have the help they need.
So, most of them have to go to get the groceries themselves
and also, many people go to do groceries in by cars. They just
buy groceries for themselves and most of the space in the car
is not used which can be used to get extra stuff for
elderly people living near them. This will not only be
helpful for general public but it might also be good for
enviroment as people may start pool shoping 
and stop doing groceries in multiple cars.

## Goals of requirements gathering:

* How would the users like to know about the people in need?
    * Do they want to browse through the list of people in need?
    * Do they want to post about themselves that they are available
        for anyone in need of help

* Would the users be comfortable accepting things that others bought?
    Especially the produce sections such as fresh fruits and
    vegetables as people generally like to hand pick these items.

* How whould they users like to pay for the groceries bought by someone else?
    * Do they want to have an in-app payment system?
    * Or do they want to pay the helper directly by cash or e-transfer?

* How are the helpers willing to receive the money?
    * In app payment?
    * Or direct transer/cash?

* Would the users like:
    * Have a menu in the app for each store?
    * Post their list and don't care about what store it is bought from?

* Which is more prefered?
    * Store employees preparing the order and delivery by a helper?
    * Or the helpers prepare and deliver the list?
